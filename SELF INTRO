Hi, I'm Dhanush Kumar! ðŸ‘‹
I'm an engineering graduate with a strong focus on energy systems, robotics, sensors, and embedded systems. Iâ€™m also a member of a drone club, working under battery management. Throughout my academic and project experiences, Iâ€™ve worked on several exciting areas, including:

Energy Systems: Developing wind energy harvesting systems, integrating turbines and coreless BLDC motors to generate power for wireless sensor networks and to model mathematically.

Robotics: Worked on projects like designing autonomous robots for specific task mainly creating a river cleaning bot, exploring ways to improve robot functionality and task efficiency.

Sensors & Embedded Systems: Focused on integrating various sensors into my projects, while working with embedded systems to improve automation and energy optimization in different applications.

Drone Club (Battery Management): As a member of a drone club, I contribute to the development and management of battery systems, working on ways to improve energy efficiency and performance in drone applications.

Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects related to renewable energy, automation, and robotics. Feel free to check out my repositories and get in touch!
